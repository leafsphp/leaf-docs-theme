## Test 2


You can get this tool up and running on your system using composer:

```bash
composer global require leafs/cli
```

Make sure to place Composer's system-wide vendor bin directory in your `$PATH` so the leaf executable can be located by your system. This directory exists in different locations based on your operating system; however, some common locations include:

- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin`
- macOS: `$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin`
- GNU / Linux Distributions: `$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin` or `$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin`

You could also find the composer's global installation path by running `composer global about` and looking up from the first line.

Eg (Adding composer bin to path linux):

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin
```

Eg (Adding composer bin to path mac):

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin
echo $PATH
```

::: tip NOTE
To get leaf cli installed permanently, you will need to add your composer bin your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file on mac and linux.

**zsh:**

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**bash:**

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Creating a leaf app

To start a new project, simply open up your console or terminal and move into the directory you want to generate your project. From there, you can use the `create` command:

```bash
leaf create <project-name>
```

with leaf 3:

```bash
leaf create <project-name> --v3
```

or with leaf 2:

```bash
leaf create <project-name> --v2
```

This will now prompt you to select a preset

```bash
Creating a new Leaf app "<project-name>" in ./projects-directory.

* Please pick a preset 
  [0] leaf
  [1] leaf mvc
  [2] leaf api
  [3] skeleton
 > 
```

::: tip
Note that you are to select a number, not type the name of the preset.
:::

Selecting a number will generate a leaf app based on the associated preset. As you can see, there are 4 presets:

- **Leaf**: a bare leaf project
- **Leaf MVC**: a leaf MVC project with leaf 2
- **Leaf API**: a leaf API project with leaf 2
- **Skeleton**: a leaf skeleton project

After picking a preset, if no version was specified, leaf will display an interactive version picker like the one above:

```bash
* Select a version to use 
  [0] v3
  [1] v2
 >
```

your project will be automatically generated and initialized. All you need to do is open it up and start coding ðŸš€

### Adding Tests

From Leaf CLI v2.3, you will be asked if you want to add tests to your project. You can add tests by replying `y`.

```bash
* Add testing with Leaf Alchemy? [y, n] y

 - Adding alchemy for tests
```

For a quicker method, you can use the `--phpunit` or `--pest` option to add tests to your project using PHPUnit or Pest respectively. You can also use the `--no-tests` option to completely skip adding tests.

```bash
leaf create <project-name> --no-tests
```

### Quick presets

Leaf CLI also provides a quicker way to initialize your project without having to go through the interactive installer. You can use the `--mvc`, `--api`, `--basic` and `--skeleton` options to generate your project based on a specific presets. `--basic` generates a raw leaf project.

eg: `leaf create backend-api --api`

This will create a leaf api project named `backend-api`.

### Versioning

If no version is specified, leaf displays the interactive installer to you, however, to quickly install a particular version, you can use the `--v2` or `--v3` options. These can be coupled with presets as well.

Leaf API 3 example:

```bash
leaf create backend-api --api --v3
```

## Running your leaf apps

After generating your leaf app, you can `cd` into the directory and spin up a local dev server using leaf cli's `serve` command.

```bash
cd backend-api
leaf serve
```

You can also specify the port to run your leaf app on using the `--port` or `-p` options.

```bash
leaf serve -p 3000
```

### File watching

In v2.1, you can also start the leaf server with hot module watching. This reloads your application anytime a change is made to your application code. To get started, simply start the leaf server with the `--watch` flag.

```bash
leaf serve --port 8000 --watch
```

### Dependency Management

The serve command also now installs dependencies when there is no `vendor` folder present in the current working directory.

## Testing your Leaf apps

Testing helps prevent bugs in your app which you may not catch until you publish your app to production. Leaf introduced a test runner which helps you initialize testing and run tests in your app without needing any config first. Alchemy has also been integrated into the Leaf CLI and so you can use it's functionality directly.

### Setting up tests

Leaf CLI allows you to setup tests in your project with one command:

```bash
leaf test:setup
```

This command will generate Pest PHP tests for your application. If you however want to use PHPUnit, you'll need to pass the `--phpunit` option to the command.

```bash
leaf test:setup --phpunit
```

### Running tests

To run tests you've setup or created, you can simply run the `test` command.

```bash
leaf test
```

## Installing packages

This cli tool also adds a feature to install leaf packages from composer.

```bash
leaf install leafs/ui
```

If you are installing a leaf module or package, you can leave out the `leafs/` part.

```bash
leaf install ui
```

You can also pass in a bunch of packages to install at once.

```bash
leaf install ui db illuminate/support
```

***Versioning***

Leaf CLI also allows you to install a particular version of any package using `@`

```bash
leaf install ui@1.0 illuminate/support@9.0.2
```

***Package Chaining***

You can now add a bunch of packages to install as done with composer, npm and other CLIs as well.

```bash
leaf install db illuminate/support
```

Using this method, you can even add specific versions of some packages like this:

```bash
leaf install db illuminate/support@9.0.2 nesbot/carbon
```

## Interactive Shell

You can also use the interactive shell to interact with your app.

```bash
$ leaf interact
...
>>> $user = new User;
...
>>> $user->name = "Mychi";
...
>>> $user->save();
```

## Updating leaf cli

v2 contains an easy way to quickly update leaf cli to the latest version.

```bash
leaf update
```

## Running Scripts

Leaf CLI also now allows you run scripts defined in your `composer.json` file. For example, if you have this in your composer.json:

You can run the test script like this:

```bash
leaf run test
```

This is the full list of commands available with Leaf CLI 2. A new update command has been added to allow you seamlessly update leaf CLI without having to run a bunch of commands. You don't even need to run this manually since leaf cli will automatically check for updates and upgrade to the latest stable release.
